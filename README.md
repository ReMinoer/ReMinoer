# About me

I'm a game developer, working as a Tool programmer at Ubisoft. I code mostly with C#/.NET.

I'm globally interested by game development, but also by languages & UX.

I tends to create small libraries & tools on GitHub when my bigger personal projects need them but I don't like to release them as package/application (for now). :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:
